                        Matthew Sickels was born on November 5th, 2000, in Des Moines, Iowa. His parents were young parents and struggled financially. His mom was someone who struggled a lot with day-to-day life. This led to his parents separating. His father fought for custody for a long time and finally gained it. This was a major turning point in Matt’s life. If it were not for his dad fighting for him, he would not be the man he is today.
In his free time, Matthew enjoys hiking, camping, playing video games with friends, and doing tree work with his family. Matt just recently traveled to the state of Colorado for a weeklong camping trip. While he was there, he and his friend climbed Mount Elbert which is 14,433 feet above sea level. When playing video games Matt tends to choose between Pokémon, Forza Horizon and Red Dead Redemption. On the weekends during the warmer months Matt participates in his father’s tree work business.
It is evident that Matt really enjoys being outside. In fact, if he could, he would like to either be a wildlife and landscape photographer or a park ranger. He would also like to travel across Europe and visit the countries of Germany, Scotland, and New Zealand. He wants to live a life full of adventure and new things.
The most important things to Matt are his friends, pets and family. That is why it is no surprise that Matt’s hero is his dad. Matt says that his dad gave up a lot for him. Even though his father did not have much to give, he fought to have full custody of him, and gave him a good life. Matt really looks up to his father. He bases many of his own morals off those his father has. Matt is proudest of the way his siblings look up to him.
